USBtiny
=======

USBtiny is a software implementation of the USB low-speed protocol for
the Atmel ATtiny microcontrollers. Of course, it will also work on the
ATmega series. The software is written for an AVR clocked at 12 MHz.
At this frequency, each bit on the USB bus takes 8 clock cycles, and
with a lot of trickery, it is possible to decode and encode the USB
waveforms by software. The USB driver needs between 1300 and 1400
bytes of flash space (excluding the optional identification strings),
depending on the configuration and compiler version, and 46 bytes RAM
(excluding stack space). The C interface consists of 3 to 5 functions,
depending on the configuration.


Implementation
==============

USB uses two differential data signals, D+ and D-, which are normally
complementary. However, the end of a packet is signalled by pulling
both signals low. Data is not transmitted directly on the USB bus, it
is NRZI encoded first. This means that a "0" bit is encoded as a bit
change, and a "1" bit is encoded as no bit change. After 6 "1" bits,
"bit stuffing" takes place to force a change on the USB signal lines.

The software is interrupt driven: the start of a USB packet triggers
an interrupt. The interrupt handler synchronizes with the sync byte,
removes the NRZI encoding and bit stuffing, and stores the packed in
one of the two RAM buffers. Two buffers are used so that the next
packet can be received while the current one is being processed.
Depending on the packet type, a reply packed may be sent back
immediately in the interrupt handler.

The rest of the USB driver is written in C. A usb_poll() function
must to be called periodically to poll for incoming packets. Only a
single endpoint is supported at the moment. Standard control requests
are directly handled by the USB driver. Other SETUP requests are
forwarded to a user-supplied function usb_setup(). Support for large
replies and OUT control requests is optional, see usbtiny.h.

To use the USB driver in your own application, you need to configure
the macros in usbtiny.h, and provide a function usb_setup() to handle
SETUP control packets. Optionally, you need to provide the functions
usb_in() and usb_out(). Your code needs to call the initialization
function usb_init() at program startup, and usb_poll() at regular
intervals. The AVR device type and the upload command should be
configured at the top of the Makefile.


Other USB projects
==================

This software was inspired by two similar USB projects for the AVR:

  http://www.cesko.host.sk/IgorPlugUSB/IgorPlug-USB%20(AVR)_eng.htm
  http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/index.html

My version has the advantage that you have more freedom over which I/O
pins to use for the D+ and D- USB signals. You don't need to use bit 0
for the D+ signal. The only restriction is that both signals should be
on the same I/O port. When you select a pin for D+ that can also
generate an interrupt, only two I/O pins are required. The pin-change
interrupt is deliberately not used, so that it remains available for
other uses.

Another improvement is that the CRC calculation is faster, because it
uses a lookup table. A bit-wise calculation turned out to be too slow
for the USB controller in my laptop. For instance, the obdev code
worked fine on my desktop computer, but not on my laptop.

Apart from these advantages, I think that my code is more readable and
easier to configure, but that impression may be caused by a mild form
of the NIH syndrome that I'm suffering from. In any case, I learned a
lot about the USB protocol, and writing the interrupt handler was a
nice puzzle.


Hardware
========

The AVR must be clocked with an external 12 MHz crystal. For an
ATtiny2313, this means that the low fuse byte must be reprogrammed,
for instance to 0xff. I also recommend to enable the BOD circuit,
when available. For the ATtiny2313, this means programming the high
fuse byte to 0xdb (BOD level is 2.7V).

The USB data signals are specified at 3.3V. The easiest way to
accomplish this is to use a 3.3V power supply for the AVR. However,
driving the USB signals with 5V seems to work as well, which may be
more convenient when you need to interface to 5V peripherals.
According to the USB specification, a device should not be damaged
by 5V signals. I've been running the AVR and USB bus at 5V, and I
haven't encounter any problems so far.


USBtiny SPI converter
=====================

My first USBtiny application is a USB to SPI (Serial Programming
Interface) converter. The SPI signals are connected to a female DB-25
connecter, so that the converter can be plugged onto my AVR parallel
port programmer. Because the most important parallel port signals are
connected to the DB-25 connecter, the same hardware (with different
firmware) could be used to control other parallel port devices. That
is also the reason why I connected the ACK signal to the INT1 pin.
I didn't bother to put capacitors on the crystal, but they are
recommended for reliable operation. The software, the schematic and
a Python test script can be found in the "spi" subdirectory.

The circuit may be powered via the diode at pin 14 of the DB-25
connector to enable reprograming the ATtiny2313 in-system. This
requires an adaptor cable between another SPI programmer and a DB-25
male connector with the following connections:

  SPI  DB25
  ---  ----
  GND    25
  VCC    14
  RESET  13
  SCK     9
  MISO    8
  MOSI    7

Bit-banging the SPI signals via USB turned out to be very slow. To get
reasonable programming speeds, I've moved the SPI algorithm into the
AVR. This means that you can send a 32-bit SPI command in a single USB
packet. In addition, you can read or write up to 255 bytes from/to
flash or EEPROM in a single control transfer.

The subdirectory "patches" contains a patch for avrdude-5.1 that adds
support for controlling this SPI converter. The programmer name is
"usbtiny". You can use the -B option or the "sck" command to specify
the minimum SCK period in microseconds (range: 1..250, default: 10).


USBtiny LIRC compatible IR receiver and LCD controller
======================================================

A second USBtiny application is a receiver for infrared remote
controls that can be used with the LIRC package (http://www.lirc.org/).
The firmware stores the mark/space timings from a TSOP1738 IR decoder
in a buffer that is polled by a LIRC device driver. As a visual
feedback, a LED is flashed when a signal is being received. As an
additional feature, a 2x16 LCD display is attached to PORTB. You can
control the display via the USB bus. The software, the schematic and
a Python test script can be found in the "ir" subdirectory.

I adopted the "IgorPlug-USB" protocol, so that the existing LIRC
device driver "igorplugusb" could be used without modifications.
Nevertheless, a patch for lirc-0.8.0 is included in the "patches"
subdirectory, with the following modifications:
1) A compilation fix for the latest 2.6 Linux kernels.
2) An increase of the sample rate from 10 to 100 times per second.
   This is not required, but improves the responsiveness and repeat
   behavior for some remote controls.


Tools
=====

The software was developed on a Linux system. In addition to standard
tools like GNU make, you need the AVR versions of gcc, binutils and
glibc to build the code: On a Debian system, you can apt-get the
following packages:

  gcc-avr
  binutils-avr
  avr-libc

To upload the code to an AVR, I use avrdude with a parallel port
programmer.

I currently use gcc-3.4.3 with the -Os option, which generates
reasonable compact code. Unfortunately, newer versions like gcc-4.1.0
generate about 10% more code, and as a result, the application code
may not fit in 2K anymore. To make it fit, you can remove the optional
vendor and device strings, by undefining the USBTINY_VENDOR_NAME and
USBTINY_DEVICE_NAME macros.

The schematics are created with gschem, which is part of the gEDA
package. The conversion to Postscript is done with a script that
invokes gschem non-interactively. The current version (20060123) is a
little unstable, but compensates for this with an auto-backup feature.

The "util" and application code subdirectories each contain their own
Makefile. In addition, there is a global Makefile that recursively
invokes all other Makefiles.


Host software
=============

The subdirectory "utils" contains a Python module "usbtiny.py" that
defines a class USBtiny that can be used to communicate with the
USBtiny firmware. This class is used by the test scripts.

The usbtiny.py module uses a Python wrapper around libusb that is
generated by "swig". Type "make" to build the wrapper. Of course, you
need to have swig, libusb and libusb-dev installed on your system.

Libusb needs appropriate permissions to open a USB device. This means
that you either have to run the scripts as "root", or you should
configure the hotplug system to relax the permissions of the device
file created under /proc/bus/usb/ when the device is plugged in.

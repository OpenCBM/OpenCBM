/*! \brief Decode GCR data

 This function decodes a buffer of 5 GCR bytes into a buffer
 of 4 plain bytes

 \param source
   The pointer to the source buffer of 5 read-only GCR bytes

 \param dest
   The pointer to the destination buffer of 4 plain bytes

 \param sourceLength
   The size of the source buffer, it should be greater or
   equal to 5. If the size given is less than or equal to 0,
   this is taken as assertion, since it denotes unwanted
   programming behaviour.

 \param destLength
   The size of the destination buffer, it should be greater
   or equal to 4. If the size given is less than or equal
   to 0 this is taken as assertion, since it denotes
   unwanted programming behaviour.

 \return
   0 means (partial) success, -1 means failure due to
   invalid buffer pointers or a sourceLength of less than
   or equal to 0. Codes from 1 to 255 denote a bitmask of
   8 bits with each representing an illegal GCR nybble
   code, when set to one.

 Remarks:

 The function in fact can be called with buffer lengths less
 than recommended, it then does partial conversions as long
 as there is input available or as long as output buffer
 bytes are allowed to be written.

 The source and destination buffer pointers are allowed to
 overlap partially. As long as destination is less than
 source+2 or as long as destination is bigger than source+4,
 it is allowed to let the buffers overlap. Other conditions
 are taken as assertions since conversion errors will occur
 (data taken as input gets overwritten before). This
 behaviour allows to construct in-place buffer conversions.
